# Docker

Docker es una plataforma que automatiza el deploy, escalado y administracion de aplicaciones usando containers

Key Concepts
Containers: Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient environments that include everything needed to run a piece of software, including the code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Containers share the same operating system kernel, making them much more efficient than traditional virtual machines (VMs).

Images: An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. Images are built from a series of layers, and each layer represents a step in the image-building process. Images can be pulled from public or private repositories.

Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains a series of instructions on how to build a Docker image. It specifies the base image, application code, dependencies, and other necessary configurations.

Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service that allows you to find and share container images with your team. It's the default registry used by Docker and hosts public and private images.

Key Components
Docker Engine: The core of Docker, it is a client-server application that builds and runs Docker containers. It consists of:

Docker Daemon (dockerd): The background service running on the host that manages Docker images, containers, networks, and storage volumes.
Docker Client (docker): The command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the Docker daemon.
